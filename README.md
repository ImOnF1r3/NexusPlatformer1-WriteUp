# Solution (!)

### Level 1: Terminal Decryption

1. The password is an 8-character string that includes uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters, but no lowercase letters.
2. The position pattern provided is acababbc.

Using hashcat, the command to crack the hash is:

hashcat -a 3 -m 1400 f051d420e47f6ecaa61e344768a506bbea842baf5c1948a815bebb3d4c0aef97 -1 '?u' -2 '?d' -3 '?s' '?1?3?1?3?1?2?2?3'

### Level 2: Coin Manipulation

1. You start with 10 coins and need to reach at least 21 coins.
2. You can only add one coin at a time.

Using Cheat Engine, increment the coin count one by one, ensuring the game does not detect any sudden, unrealistic changes.

### Level 3: Teleportation in the Void

1. Open the map using the [m] key to locate the destination point.
2. Use Cheat Engine to edit the playerâ€™s coordinates to teleport to the desired location.
