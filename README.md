NOTE : The headings with (!) should be necessarily included in your writeup while the ones with (*) are optional and should be included only if there is a need to. Of course, you can modify the content of each section accordingly. We just provide some boilerplate text.

## Description (!)

- The challenge consists of three levels, each requiring different skills and techniques to solve. The goal is to navigate through these levels using provided hints and tools.
-  NexusPlatformer1, offers an engaging and moderately challenging experience that combines technical skills with creative problem-solving. Each level, from cracking SHA-256 hashes to manipulating game variables and teleporting through voids, is designed to test and enhance your abilities in a fun and stimulating way. The aim is to provide both an educational and enjoyable adventure that pushes the boundaries of your reverse engineering and problem-solving skills.

## Skills Required (!)

- Hashcat
- Cheat Engine

## Skills Learned (!)

- Learn how SHA-256 cracking works.
- Learn how to manipulate game variables using Cheat Engine.
- Learn how to teleport within a game environment by modifying coordinates.

# Solution (!)

### Level 1: Terminal Decryption

1. The password is an 8-character string that includes uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters, but no lowercase letters.
2. The position pattern provided is acababbc.

Using hashcat, the command to crack the hash is:

hashcat -a 3 -m 1400 f051d420e47f6ecaa61e344768a506bbea842baf5c1948a815bebb3d4c0aef97 -1 '?u' -2 '?d' -3 '?s' '?1?3?1?3?1?2?2?3'

-a 3: Specifies the attack mode (brute-force).
-m 1400: Indicates the hash type (SHA-256).
-1 '?u' -2 '?d' -3 '?s': Defines custom character sets:
?u for uppercase letters.
?d for digits.
?s for special characters.
'?1?3?1?3?1?2?2?3': Represents the password pattern based on the hints.
The pattern acababbc translates to:

a (uppercase)
c (special character)
a (uppercase)
b (uppercase)
a (uppercase)
b (digit)
b (digit)
c (special character)

### Level 2: Coin Manipulation

1. You start with 10 coins and need to reach at least 21 coins.
2. You can only add one coin at a time.

To solve this level, you can use Cheat Engine, a memory scanner/debugger for Windows, which allows you to manipulate the game's variables.

Download and Install Cheat Engine: If you haven't already, download Cheat Engine from its official website and install it on your system.
Attach Cheat Engine to the Game: Open Cheat Engine and attach it to the running process of the game.
Find the Coin Variable:
Start with an initial scan for the current number of coins (1).
Collect a coin in the game and then perform a next scan for the new value (2).
Repeat this process until you narrow down the address that holds the coin count.
Modify the Coin Count: Once you have identified the correct memory address, increment the coin count one by one, ensuring that you do not add more than one coin at a time to avoid detection by the game's anti-cheat mechanisms.
By carefully adjusting the coin count, you can gradually reach the required 21 coins without triggering any alarms.

### Level 3: Teleportation in the Void

1. Open the map using the [m] key to locate the destination point.
2. Use Cheat Engine to edit the playerâ€™s coordinates to teleport to the desired location.

Move your character slightly and perform a next scan for the new coordinates.
Repeat until you identify the addresses that store the X, Y, and possibly Z coordinates.
Modify the Coordinates: Change the values of the identified addresses to teleport your character to the desired location on the map.
By carefully adjusting the player's coordinates, you can navigate through the void and reach the target area to complete the level.
